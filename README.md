## Additional Information

<summary>Project History & Technical Details</summary>

### History
Echoir is the successor to FluidAC, reimagined with major improvements:
- Comprehensive metadata support
- Background download capabilities
- Full open-source availability
- Significantly reduced APK size

### Technical Notes
- Echoir uses a custom-built minimal version of [ffmpeg-kit](https://github.com/imjyotiraditya/ffmpeg-kit), significantly reduced from the [original by Arthenica](https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit). Our build only includes FLAC support, drastically reducing the library size.

- **Why FFmpeg?**
  While Echoir is strictly a downloader (no transcoding), FFmpeg is essential for Hi-Res Lossless content. Here's why:
  - Hi-Res content is delivered via MPEG-DASH with segmented URLs
  - The process:
    1. Download all segments individually
    2. Use simple FFmpeg command: `-i input -c copy output`
    3. The `-c copy` flag ensures:
       - Direct stream copy without re-encoding
       - Pure concatenation of segments
       - No quality loss or modification
  - The code is open-source and can be audited to verify this simple operation

Note: For Lossless CD Quality and Dolby Atmos formats, direct downloads are used without any FFmpeg processing.
